You are orchestrating a simple three-agent workflow to add a basic "CSV Export" feature. This is a quick demonstration of multi-agent collaboration.

**SIMPLE WORKFLOW:**

1. **Software Engineer**: Add a basic CSV export feature
   • Create /api/export endpoint that returns sample CSV data
   • Add "Export CSV" button to the main page
   • Keep it simple and fast

2. **QA Analyst**: Write one simple test
   • Test that the export button exists
   • Test that the API returns CSV data
   • Just one basic test file

3. **Documentation Writer**: Update README
   • Add a brief section about the CSV export feature
   • Just a few lines explaining what it does

**EXECUTION:**
• Use local_server___software_engineer, local_server___qa_analyst, local_server___documentation_writer tools
• Keep each phase simple and fast
• Make actual file changes and commits
• Create a pull request

**GOAL:**
Demonstrate multi-agent collaboration by having each agent contribute to a simple feature. Focus on speed and simplicity.
