You need to add professional badges and improve the structure of the README.md file that was previously enhanced with emojis.

**TASK DEFINITION:**
This is a follow-up task to the initial emoji enhancement. Add professional badges, improve document structure, and ensure the README has proper organization for a complete documentation experience.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
- Add relevant badges (build status, license, version, etc.)
- Improve document structure and organization
- Add table of contents if needed
- Ensure proper section hierarchy
- Maintain the existing emoji enhancements from the previous task

**AVAILABLE SUBAGENTS:**
- **badge-generator** - Native subagent that specializes in creating professional badges for repositories
- **structure-organizer** - Native subagent that focuses on improving document structure and organization

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Professional badges added to README
- Improved document structure and organization
- Table of contents if appropriate
- Maintained visual appeal from previous emoji enhancements

**APPROACH:**
Use the badge-generator and structure-organizer subagents to add professional elements and improve the overall structure while preserving the visual enhancements from the previous task.

**COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**
Once you have successfully added badges and improved structure:

1. **Create a new branch** - Use git commands to create a new feature branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b badges-structure-$(date +%s)
   ```

2. **Commit your changes** - Stage and commit all your work:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "docs: add professional badges and improve README structure"
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request with Automatic Push** - Use `gh` to handle both pushing and PR creation:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "✅ docs: add professional badges and improve README structure" --body "Added professional badges and improved document structure as a follow-up to the emoji enhancement task." --base main
   ```
   
   **Important**: GitHub CLI will automatically push the branch and create the PR without any user interaction.

**IMPORTANT**: The PR title MUST start with the ✅ emoji as the first character.

The pull request should clearly document the structural improvements and badges added to help reviewers understand the enhancements.

Begin adding badges and improving the document structure.
