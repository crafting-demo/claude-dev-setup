You need to implement a CSV export feature for this repository. The feature should allow users to export inventory data in CSV format.

**FEATURE DEFINITION:**
Create a system that exports inventory/product data to CSV files. Users should be able to click a button or link to download a CSV file containing product information like names, SKUs, quantities, prices, categories, and other relevant inventory fields.

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Backend**: REST API endpoint (e.g., `/api/export` or `/export`) that generates and returns CSV data
- **Frontend**: User interface element (button, link, or menu item) that triggers the CSV download
- **Data Format**: Proper CSV with headers, comma-separated values, proper escaping for special characters
- **Sample Data**: Include realistic inventory data (products, quantities, prices, etc.) for demonstration

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
- Simple, intuitive way to access the export function
- Immediate file download when triggered
- Filename should be descriptive (e.g., "inventory-export-2024-01-15.csv")
- Should work in standard web browsers

**AVAILABLE AGENTS:**
- **front_end_engineer** - Specializes in UI components, client-side functionality, and user experience
- **back_end_engineer** - Focuses on APIs, server-side logic, data processing, and backend infrastructure
- **documentation_writer** - Updates documentation, writes user guides, and documents features

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Working CSV export endpoint
- UI element to trigger exports
- Updated documentation explaining the feature

**WORKFLOW:**
Use an iterative approach with multiple rounds of feedback and revisions to demonstrate persistent session capabilities:

1. **Initial Implementation**: Assign tasks to each specialized agent
2. **Review & Feedback**: After each agent completes their work, carefully review the output for:
   - Code quality and best practices
   - Integration between frontend and backend
   - User experience improvements
   - Documentation completeness
3. **Revision Cycles**: Go back to agents with specific feedback and requests for improvements
4. **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Ensure frontend and backend work together seamlessly

**APPROACH:**
Coordinate with the available agents through multiple iterations to deliver a polished, working feature. Each agent brings specialized expertise - use them strategically and don't hesitate to ask for revisions or improvements. The goal is to showcase how persistent sessions enable sophisticated back-and-forth collaboration between agents.
