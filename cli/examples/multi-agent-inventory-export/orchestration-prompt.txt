You need to implement a CSV export feature for this repository. The feature should allow users to export inventory data in CSV format.

**FEATURE DEFINITION:**
Create a system that exports inventory/product data to CSV files. Users should be able to click a button or link to download a CSV file containing product information like names, SKUs, quantities, prices, categories, and other relevant inventory fields.

**TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Backend**: REST API endpoint (e.g., `/api/export` or `/export`) that generates and returns CSV data
- **Frontend**: User interface element (button, link, or menu item) that triggers the CSV download
- **Data Format**: Proper CSV with headers, comma-separated values, proper escaping for special characters
- **Sample Data**: Include realistic inventory data (products, quantities, prices, etc.) for demonstration

**USER EXPERIENCE:**
- Simple, intuitive way to access the export function
- Immediate file download when triggered
- Filename should be descriptive (e.g., "inventory-export-2024-01-15.csv")
- Should work in standard web browsers

**AVAILABLE AGENTS:**
- **software_engineer** - Can implement code, create APIs, build UI components
- **qa_analyst** - Can write tests, validate functionality, ensure quality
- **documentation_writer** - Can update docs, write user guides, document features

**DELIVERABLES:**
- Working CSV export endpoint
- UI element to trigger exports
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Updated documentation explaining the feature

**APPROACH:**
Coordinate with the available agents to deliver a complete, working feature. Each agent brings different expertise - use them strategically based on what needs to be accomplished. The implementation should be practical and user-focused.
